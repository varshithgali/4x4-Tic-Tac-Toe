# 4x4-Tic-Tac-Toe
The project has been created as a part of Undergraduate Computer Science Engineering Project for the Subject of "Artificial Intelligence". The project creates a live 4x4 grid Tic-Tac-Toe creating a virtual environment for playing the game on a human player versus AI counterpart.

We have used the concepts of Alpha-Beta Pruning and Minimax Algorithm for creating a live virtual working model of a 4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe Game. The Game is quite simple to understand once you jump-in. Do try playing the game as it is still at Beta-Testing level it cannot be played on a bigger scale yet.
